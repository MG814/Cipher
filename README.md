- Pytest
- Pre-commit


## Startup
To run the program, just create a virtual Python environment by typing the following command in the terminal:

`python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

Then activate the created environment by typing the appropriate command:
on Windows:

`C:\> <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat`

on POSIX:

`$ source <venv>/bin/activate`
 
 Before running the program, you still need to enter the following command:

`pip -r install requirements.txt`

This will download the file with all the necessary extensions.
To run the program, type:

`python main.py`
